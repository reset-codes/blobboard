# [Blob Board](https://blobboard.wal.app)

## Overview

Blob Board is a user-friendly dashboard designed to calculate and visualize storage and write costs, as well as potential revenues, for the Walrus decentralized storage platform . Walrus enables secure, on-chain storage of large binary files (blobs) such as images, videos, and other media. This tool helps users estimate costs in WAL tokens, convert them to USD, and project revenues based on total data stored and the current cost.

## Features

- **Cost Calculations**:
  - WAL needed for 1 GB or 1 TB per epoch of storage.
  - One-time write fees for 1 GB or 1 TB.

- **Storage Cost Projections**:
  - Cost breakdowns for 1 day, 1 epoch (that's 14 days), and a full year (365 days) on any amount of data—like 1 TB.
  - Instant USD conversions using the latest WAL price.

- **Revenue Estimations**:
  - Daily, monthly, and yearly earnings from total data stored (say, 1,100 TB).
  - Payout projections for storage nodes in WAL and USD.

- **Customizable Inputs**:
  - Tweak stuff like frost per MiB per epoch, total data stored, or the amount you're storing right in the UI.

- **Live Crypto Prices**:
  - Shows up-to-date prices for WAL, SUI, and BTC.

- **Additional Metrics**:
  - Quick conversions: 1 WAL = 1,000,000,000 frost | 1 GB = 1,024 MiB | 1 TB = 1,024 GB | 1 epoch = 14 days | 1 year = 365 days.

This dashboard provides clear data for comparison with other storage providers by including USD equivalents, making it easier to evaluate Walrus's cost-effectiveness.

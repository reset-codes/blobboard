# Here is a PDF of a design philosophy I tried giving it to a AI coder CLI, but it wasn't able to analyze it. I want you to analyze it and give me a description of it so that the AI coder can understand and make the right choices. Below are the few things which the AI coder asked me to share. If you feel anything is worth sharing, do share that too.

Could you please share the key points from the brand guideline, such as:

1. Color Palette: Primary, secondary, and accent colors.
2. Typography: Font families, sizes, and weights (though you mentioned not to change the typography).
3. Logo Usage: How and where the logo should be used.
4. Design Principles: Any specific design philosophies or guidelines mentioned (e.g., minimalism, boldness,
playfulness).
5. Spacing/Alignment: Preferred spacing units or grid systems.

The PDF file "Walrus_BrandGuideline_2.0.pdf" that was attached cannot be directly parsed by me because the technical method to read its content (like PyPDF2) is not available in this environment, and direct fetch from the attached file was unsuccessful.

However, I have access to the file's content snippet you provided initially, which includes a very detailed and structured overview of the Walrus brand guidelines. Based on this snippet, I can extract and compose a clear, concise summary addressing the key points your AI coder needs:

## Walrus Brand Guideline Summary for AI Coder

### Color Palette

- **Primary colors:** Walrus Green (Mint), Walrus Purple (Grape), White, and Black.
- **Primary color roles:** Evergreen brand applications representing the core Walrus identity.
- **Tints/Shades:** Variations with five levels of tints in both primary colors (Mint and Grape) to create depth and distinguish content blocks.
- **Secondary palette:** Used for websites and illustrations to add depth and legibility, includes colors like Lime, Pears, Mandarin, Almond, Guava, Blueberry, Banana.
- **Color usage constraints:** Specific rules about logo color combinations, e.g., colored logos on green or dark backgrounds preferred, monochrome logos only when color visibility is compromised.


### Typography

- **Font families:**
    - *NeueBit Bold* for large headers (1-5 words, all caps, tight letter spacing).
    - *Neue Montreal Medium* for subheaders, accents, buttons.
    - *Neue Montreal Regular* for body copy, with specific line height and letter spacing to maintain readability.
- **Alternative fonts:**
    - *Inter Tight* recommended for external partners or when brand fonts cannot be used.
    - *Noto Sans* for unsupported languages.
- **Usage specifics:** Tight and consistent letter spacing with a leading from 120% to 160% for body text, and special care for uppercase style in headlines.


### Logo Usage

- The logo consists of two main elements: the icon (character) and the wordmark.
- The **primary logo** is a horizontal lockup combining both icon and wordmark.
- The **vertical lockup** is an alternative only used when horizontal is unsuitable.
- Clear space around the logo is mandatory: at least 1/3 of the logo’s height to avoid crowding.
- Icon can be used standalone as a brand element.
- Wordmark alone may be used in layouts where the icon appears elsewhere or for internal/fun assets.
- Partnership lockup: balanced logos separated by a line, both with equal visual weight.
- Logo color: Prefer primary brand colors, with clear rules on color backgrounds for visibility.


### Design Principles

- Brand communicates a **forward-thinking, digital-era mindset** bridging Web2 and Web3.
- Use of grid systems representing structure, flexibility, and creativity to maintain alignment and organization.
- Brand illustration is a key storytelling tool — a unique "Walrus Mint" skin tone is consistent, while outfits/postures vary to depict narratives.
- Brand uses bold, bitmap-inspired design language.
- Patterns using the "W" icon as background or content frames for consistent branding.
- Strong emphasis on clarity, legibility, and spacing while preserving creativity and distinctiveness.


### Spacing / Alignment

- Logo: clear space equal to 1/3 of logo height.
- Typography leading:
    - Headlines: between 60%–65% for NeueBit, 100%–120% for functional headlines using Neue Montreal Bold.
    - Body copy: 120%-160% leading preferred.
- Line length: ideal body paragraph line length between 40 and 75 characters (about 8 English words).
- Use of grids for layout consistency, with rules against clutter, non-brand colors for strokes, and overly thick lines.
- Letter spacing tightly controlled (negative letter spacing for certain headers).

If needed, this summary can be used by the AI coder to tailor interface design or apply consistent style rules programmatically according to Walrus’s brand identity.

If a more detailed breakdown or extraction of specific elements (e.g., hex codes or font weights) is needed, please advise. The brand guideline PDF contains extensive information beyond this summary that can be further unpacked.
